            <h1>Movie API | Documentation</h1>
            <h2>Objective:</h2>
            <p>To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
                application will provide users with access to information about different
                movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
                personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
            <h2>Endpoints:</h2>
            <p>/movies - Returns a list of all movies via GET method</p>
            <p>/movies/[title] - Returns data to the user about a specific movie by title via GET method</p>
            <p>/genres/[genre] - Returns data about a genre via GET method</p>
            <p>/directors/[director_name] - Returns data (bio, birth year, death year) about a specific director via GET method</p>
            <p>/users - Allows new user to register via POST method</p>
            <p>/users/[user] - Allows user to update user information (username, email, password)</p>
            <p>/users/[user]/favorites - Allows users to add a movie to their favorites (showing only text that a movie has been added) via POST method</p>
            <p>/users/[user]/favorites - Allows users to remove a movie from their favorites (showing only text that a movie has been removed) via DELETE method</p>
            <p>/users - Allows existing users to deregister (showing only a text that user account has been removed) via DELETE method</p>
